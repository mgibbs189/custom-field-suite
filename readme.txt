A custom fields management UI

== Description ==

= Custom Field Suite (CFS) is a visual custom fields management plugin. =

CFS includes over 12 field types, include text, date, wysiwyg, file upload, relationship, user, and loop (repeatable fields). With CFS, creating and managing custom fields is easy, thanks to our clean and intuitive admin UI.

It also features an [elegant, lightweight API](http://customfieldsuite.com/api.html) for loading (and saving) field values.

= Setting it up =
* Browse to the "Field Groups" admin menu
* Create a Field Group, containing one or more custom fields
* Choose where the Field Group should appear, using Placement Rules (see screenshots)
* Use the [get](http://customfieldsuite.com/api/get.html) method in your template files to display custom fields

This plugin is a free, lightweight alternative to Advanced Custom Fields.
