Visually create and manage custom fields.

== Description ==

Custom Field Suite is a custom fields plugin for WordPress. It allows you to visually create groups of custom fields. Each field group can be placed on the edit pages of your choosing. It also includes a lightweight API for displaying custom fields throughout your site.

CFS is a [fork](http://bit.ly/14vScj) of Advanced Custom Fields. The main goals of this plugin are stability, performance, and avoiding feature bloat.

= Why use CFS? =
* CFS is stable. Our top priority is keeping your data safe. We test all changes before releasing new versions.
* CFS is fast.
* CFS uses minimal resources.
* CFS supports [Gravity Forms](https://uproot.us/how-to-save-gravity-forms-data-into-custom-field-suite/).
* CFS supports custom field types (we had it before ACF).
* CFS is 100% free.
* [CFS is on GitHub!](https://github.com/logikal16/custom-field-suite/) You're encouraged to participate in the development process!

= Field Types =
* Text (api returns text)
* Textarea (api returns text with `<br />`)
* Wysiwyg Editor (api returns html)
* Date (api returns text)
* Color (api returns HEX value)
* True / False (api returns 0 or 1)
* Select (api returns array of values)
* Relationship (api returns array of post IDs)
* User (api returns array of user IDs)
* File Upload (api returns file url or attachment ID)
* Loop (a container for other fields, api returns array of arrays)

= More Features =
* Drag-n-drop field management UI
* Loop fields support unlimited nesting!
* Placement Rules allow you to customize where each field group appears
* Use the Sync feature to import existing custom field values
* [Create your own field types](http://uproot.us/custom-field-suite/docs/custom-field-type/)
